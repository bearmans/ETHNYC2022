Simple solidity contract deployed to SKALE hackathon network to proof-of-concept a very simple NFT token that gets co-minted into both wallets when both wallets connect to the contract while referencing each other.
On the most basic level this creates a blockchain event associated with two wallets at a point in time that can be referenced

# Needed:
URI reference on IPFS for metadata (images)
Immutable metadata is essential to expand usefulness of this concept for use in a larger social networking project or to reference memories, events etc
